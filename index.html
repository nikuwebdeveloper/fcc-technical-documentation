                The MOPTEC X1 is a 16-Bit personal computer developed by MOPTEC and was released in Japan in 1987 in
                Japan, 1988 in South Korea and North America, and 1989 in Europe. It was primarly designed as a response
                to the Commodore Amiga, released two years earlier in 1985. It is called the MOPTEC X1 in all regions.
            </p>
            <p>
                The MOPTEC X1 was the second personal computer designed by MOPTEC, following the MOPTEC Bark that was
                released in 1983. The MOPTEC X1 is notable for its 16:9 widescreen display.
            </p>
            <p>
                The MOPTEC X1 achieved success in Japan and South Korea but did not sell well in other regions. It
                continues to have homebrew software developed for it to this day and is popular among collectors and
                retro gamers.

                After observing the graphical capabilites of the Commodore Amiga, MOPTEC founders Kenji Matsuda and
                Takeshi Ono began developing the X1 personal computer in 1985. Both were impressed by the graphical
                capabilites of the Amiga but were not intending to compete with it, at least in Japan as it was not
                released there.
            </p>
            <p>
                The MOPTEC X1 was released on October 14, 1987 to impressive sales numbers for MOPTEC.

                The MOPTEC X1 features a 16:9 aspect ratio VGA color monitor. It was one of the first "widescreen" CRT
                monitors ever produced for a home computer.

                While the MOPTEC X1 was origionally designed as an all-around home computer, it quickly became
                associated with gaming due to its speed and graphical capabilities, espescially compared to the other
                Japanese home computers that it competed it.
            </p>
            <p>
                The MOPTEC X1 also had a number of business applications developed for it as well.
